# Meraki API

This is an API for Meraki app.
Meraki app is a stream online courses plataform.

It is being builded only with JavaSCript language.
Specifically with the MERN Stack:
```html
M - MongoDB
E - ExpressJS
R - ReactJS/ReactNative
N - NodeJS
```

I also have used another technologies and development tools like...
```html
HTML5 - (Markup language)
CSS3 - (Style language)
NodeJS - (Of course)
Yarn - (JavaScript package manager. You can use NPM also)
ExpressJS - (To implement the routes)
Mongoose - (To abstract the data base sintaxe)
Nodemon - (Just to reload the server when I save the script automatically)
```

Observation: The app is still being developing. So, it has some functionalities not implemented.
